This is my new Portoflio, it's still in progress and made using nextjs13's app directory

### How to run it locally

```bash
# copy env variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# populate env variables
```

To install all dependencies, use pnpm

```bash
pnpm install
# Than run the dev server
pnpm dev
```
